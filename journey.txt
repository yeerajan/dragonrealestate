Problem 1:
creating csv file. 
housing = pd.read_csv("data.csv") was unicodedecodeerror.

count : counts non-null values
mean: mean values
std: standard deviation, at how much distance your values is from mean
25% : 25% values are less than given(in column)
50% : 50% values are less than given(in column)
75% : similarly
